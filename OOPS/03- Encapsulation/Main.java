Abstraction means hiding the unneccessary details but showing the essential information, start the car,
get the elemt. SO this is the design issue. How is it actually being desgined, the desginers will tell you
thay, hey, I need some sort of abstraction and give me this method, this method,etc. And whatver u put inside 
this , is upto you, whatver, how u do it, how u encapsulate it, how u put methods in it, how u put class, 
how u make it work internally that is upto you. 
All that dedigners will say -> they need is just these 4 methods.
So these are the deginers people those will tell you these things.

The people who were woking on the implementation part -> the engineers for eg-> they will be like ok , 
we are working on the implementation , u want this sort of abstraction , we will achieve it via this class , 
via making this particular method , via making this get method, set method.

So the actual writing of code of that ENCAPSULATED thing-> is providing us ABSTRACTION.
That is the main difference.

Abstraction is solving design level issue 	
Encapsulation is solving implementation level issue 

Encapsulation is -> it hides the code in the single entity or whatver and protects it from the outside world.
Abstarction on the other hand->  is telling us okay, encapsualtion did all these things , hiding smtg internally
, i am abstractiona nd i am providing u some of the outside methods u can use (design way).
But how this thing is working internally -> is handlled by ENCPSULATION. 

One more simple explaiantion -> 
Abstraction focuses on the external stuff and ENCAP-> focuses on the internal working 

Abstraction is the process of gaining info, ENCAP-> process for containing info

DATA HIDING vs ENCAPSULATION ->
DH-> used for security and provate things
ENCAP-> used to hide the complexity of the system
ENCAP is a sub process in DATA hiding
